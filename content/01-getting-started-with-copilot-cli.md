# Section 1 — Getting started with Copilot CLI

| [← Previous: Prerequisites and environment setup][previous-lesson] | [Next: Instructions files →][next-lesson] |
|:--|--:|

Copilot CLI is a different operating model than chat-in-IDE. The agent runs in your terminal, executes shell commands, edits files, and uses tools directly against your working tree. This section grounds you in that model and gets your first real conversation with AssetTrack on the page.

## What you will learn

- How a Copilot CLI session is structured (turns, tool calls, approvals).
- How tool calling works in the CLI, what gets approved automatically vs. prompted, and how to keep that under control.
- How to use Copilot CLI to explore an unfamiliar codebase quickly.
- That GitHub MCP tools ship built-in — you'll use them lightly here and go deep in [Section 6][s06].

## Scenario

> [!NOTE]
> **Starting state**: clean fork of `legacy-app` from [Section 0][s00]. Both exercises in this section are **read-only / no source changes**. You'll start `mvn spring-boot:run` but you won't edit Java or template files.

You're new to AssetTrack. Before changing anything, you want to understand the layout, follow a real request through the stack, and form an opinion about what's risky. Copilot CLI is your way in.

## Tech overview: Copilot CLI fundamentals

Talking points:

- What Copilot CLI is and how it differs from Copilot chat in an IDE.
- Session lifecycle: starting a session, conversation turns, exiting.
- The model picker and what model defaults mean for a CLI session.
- The default toolset: file read, file edit, shell execution.
- Brief mention: GitHub MCP tools are available out of the box — used lightly in this section, deep dive in [Section 6][s06].
- A few quality-of-life slash commands worth knowing on day one (`/version`, `/help`, `/session`, `/resume`, `/context`).

## Exercise: First conversation with the AssetTrack codebase

Talking points:

- **Goal**: get a clear, accurate picture of AssetTrack's architecture without opening any files yourself first.
- **Files/areas touched**: none (read-only).
- **Steps**:
  - Start a Copilot CLI session inside the fork.
  - Ask Copilot to summarize the architecture and main packages.
  - Ask it to trace a request from `DashboardController` through the service layer to `AssetRepository`.
  - Ask it to call out tech debt or risk areas it noticed.
- **How to verify**: spot-check Copilot's claims against the actual files in `src/main/java/com/contoso/assettracker/`. The summary should correctly identify Spring Boot 2.7, Thymeleaf, raw JDBC repositories, and the dashboard summary stats.

## Tech overview: Tool calling, approvals, and allowed directories

Talking points:

- The tool-call model in Copilot CLI: file reads, file writes, shell execution — and how each is surfaced to you for approval.
- Allowed directories: `/add-dir`, `/list-dirs`, `/cwd`. Why scoping the agent to the repo matters on a brownfield machine.
- Approval prompts: read vs. edit vs. shell, and what "always allow for this command" really means.
- Why blanket approval (e.g., `/allow-all` or equivalent) is dangerous on a brownfield repo where the agent might decide to delete or rewrite at scale.
- Tip: review tool-call output before approving the next edit — the agent often proposes follow-ups that depend on the previous tool's results.

## Exercise: Run and inspect the app via Copilot CLI

Talking points:

- **Goal**: have Copilot start the app, exercise the UI, and produce a list of "things that look broken" — all from the CLI.
- **Files/areas touched**: none (Copilot may run shell commands but shouldn't edit source).
- **Steps**:
  - Approve a shell tool call to `mvn spring-boot:run` in the background.
  - Have Copilot use `curl` (or describe what to click) to hit the dashboard, asset list, and employee list.
  - Ask Copilot to summarize anomalies — wrong status colors, missing serial numbers, "assigned" assets with inactive employees, etc.
- **How to verify**: open `http://localhost:8080` in a browser and confirm at least one of Copilot's flagged anomalies (e.g., the dashboard color bug or messy manufacturer names) is real.

## Summary

You've now:

- Run a real Copilot CLI session against a brownfield repo.
- Seen the tool-call / approval surface in practice.
- Produced an initial mental model of AssetTrack and a small list of things worth fixing.

Next, you'll codify what you learned about the codebase as **instructions files** so Copilot keeps that context in every future session — go to [Section 2][next-lesson].
