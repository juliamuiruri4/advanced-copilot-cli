# Section 8 — Wrap-up and next steps

| [← Previous: Real-world workflow][previous-lesson] |  |
|:--|--:|

You've worked Copilot CLI through a brownfield Java + Python codebase, codified your team's conventions, built reusable skills and agents, integrated MCP, and shipped a PR. This section is a quick recap and a pointer to where to go next.

## What you will learn

- A consolidated view of the AI infrastructure you built across the course.
- How the patterns generalize beyond AssetTrack.
- Where to go next with Copilot CLI.

## Recap

Talking points:

- **Instructions** (`AGENTS.md` + scoped instruction files) — the passive context every session inherits.
- **Skills** (`python-modernizer`, `security-audit`) — invokable, narrow, well-scoped tasks.
- **Custom agents** (`spring-boot-3-migration-planner`, `test-author`) — focused personas with curated tool surfaces.
- **MCP** — the GitHub MCP tools that ship built-in plus the option to add servers; used here to read fork state and to draft / file issues.
- **Workflow** — plan-first prompting, diff review, rollback, end-to-end audit-to-PR flow.

## Generalizing beyond AssetTrack

Talking points:

- The same pattern (instructions → skills → agents → MCP → workflow) applies to any brownfield repo. Walk the learner through how to bootstrap each piece on their own codebase.
- Common variations:
  - A team coding standards `AGENTS.md` shared across many repos.
  - User-level skills for tasks that recur outside any one project (e.g., "rewrite this commit message in our team's house style").
  - Custom agents for compliance-sensitive areas (security review, license audit).
- Knowing when **not** to use any of this — for genuinely one-off, exploratory work, a plain CLI session is still the right tool.

## Suggested next steps

Talking points:

- Apply the instructions / skills / agent / MCP pattern to a real repo at work. Start with `AGENTS.md`.
- Share one skill or agent with your team. See how the conversation changes when everyone has the same one available.
- Explore the [MCP registry][mcp-registry] for a server that fits your team's external tools.
- Subscribe to the [GitHub Changelog][changelog] — Copilot CLI features evolve fast.
