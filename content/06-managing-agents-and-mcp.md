# Section 6 — Managing agents and MCP

| [← Previous: Custom agents][previous-lesson] | [Next: Real-world workflow →][next-lesson] |
|:--|--:|

Copilot CLI ships with built-in GitHub MCP tools, and it can be extended with additional MCP servers. In this section you'll learn how to inspect what's already available, configure an additional server, and use MCP tools to drive a real piece of work — drafting (and optionally filing) the AssetTrack backlog as GitHub issues.

## What you will learn

- What MCP is, what tools the GitHub MCP server exposes, and how Copilot CLI discovers them.
- How to inspect MCP tools at runtime with `/mcp`.
- How to configure an additional MCP server, with appropriate trust and secret-handling hygiene.
- How to use MCP tools to take real action on a GitHub repo without polluting upstream projects.

## Scenario

> [!NOTE]
> **Starting state**: all prior sections complete (instructions files, skills, agents). The first exercise is **read-only** against the learner's fork. The second exercise **drafts** issue bodies first and only optionally **creates** issues — and only on the learner's fork, under a dedicated label for easy cleanup.

You've built up a backlog mentally during sections 1–5: tech debt, unenforced rules, missing tests, the dashboard bug. Now you'll get that backlog into GitHub the way a real team would — through MCP.

## Tech overview: MCP in Copilot CLI

Talking points:

- What MCP is and the problem it solves (one protocol for tools, agnostic to the host).
- The built-in GitHub MCP tools shipped with Copilot CLI: read issues / PRs, search code, create issues, comment, create PRs, etc.
- Inspecting available MCP tools at runtime: `/mcp` (or the current CLI's equivalent).
- Trust model: treat MCP servers like any other dependency — review source, prefer first-party / well-known, be cautious with broad access.
- The MCP registry as a discovery surface.

## Exercise: Inspect and use the built-in GitHub MCP tools

Talking points:

- **Goal**: confirm the GitHub MCP tools are available and use a few of them to read state from the learner's fork.
- **Files/areas touched**: none (read-only).
- **Steps**:
  - Run `/mcp` (or equivalent) and list the GitHub MCP tools that are available. Note tools for issues, PRs, and search.
  - Ask Copilot to list open issues in the learner's `legacy-app` fork using MCP. (If there are none, ask it to list recent commits or open PRs.)
  - Ask Copilot to fetch a specific file (`README.md`) via MCP rather than the local filesystem and compare what comes back.
- **How to verify**:
  - `/mcp` shows GitHub tools.
  - The fetched data matches what's actually in the fork on github.com.
  - No working-tree changes are made.

## Tech overview: Configuring additional MCP servers, allowlists, and team distribution

Talking points:

- How to add an MCP server to Copilot CLI configuration (consult current docs for the exact file/path; talking-point only here).
- Differences between local (`stdio`-spawned) and remote (`http`) servers, and the auth implications of each.
- Secrets and `inputs` blocks: never commit tokens; use OAuth where available; prefer remote servers with OAuth for team distribution.
- Allowlists: limiting which tools from a server the agent is allowed to call.
- Sharing configuration with a team — repo-checked config vs. user-level config, and the tradeoffs.
- Review hygiene before adopting a third-party MCP server (publisher, source, scope of access).

## Exercise: Draft (then optionally file) the AssetTrack backlog as GitHub issues

Talking points:

- **Goal**: produce a clean backlog of issues for AssetTrack from a Copilot-driven audit, then file them on the learner's fork only, under a dedicated label.
- **Files/areas touched**: none locally; new issues created on the learner's fork only.
- **Steps**:
  - Have Copilot review what you produced in earlier sections (the `security-audit` report, the migration planner output, the business-rule gaps surfaced in test stubs from section 5).
  - Ask Copilot to produce **draft issue bodies** — title, summary, acceptance criteria — and print them. Do not create yet.
  - Review the drafts and edit any that need cleanup.
  - Use a GitHub MCP tool to create the issues on the **learner's fork** with the label `course-backlog` (or similar). Avoid the upstream `geektrainer/legacy-app` repo.
  - Optionally have Copilot dedupe / deprioritize / link related issues.
- **How to verify**:
  - On github.com, the learner's `legacy-app` fork shows new issues tagged `course-backlog`.
  - Issues cover the topics surfaced earlier: SQL audit findings, Python modernization, dashboard bug (if not yet committed), business-rule enforcement, Spring Boot 3 migration plan.
  - No issues were created on the upstream `geektrainer/legacy-app`.
- **Cleanup**: when done, the learner can close all issues with the `course-backlog` label in one go.

## Summary

You've now used MCP both as a read surface (inspecting fork state) and as a write surface (filing draft issues), with appropriate guardrails for trust and cleanup.

Next, you'll combine everything — instructions, skills, agents, and MCP — into an end-to-end workflow in [Section 7][next-lesson].
