# Advanced GitHub Copilot CLI

A hands-on course for experienced developers who are ready to take GitHub Copilot CLI beyond the basics and use it for **real-world brownfield work** — building reusable AI infrastructure (custom instructions, agent skills, custom agents, and MCP integrations) on top of an existing legacy codebase.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Because GitHub Copilot, and generative AI at large, is probabilistic rather than deterministic, the exact code, files changed, and outputs may vary between runs. You may notice slight differences between what's described here and what you see in your terminal. This is expected.

## Who this course is for

You're already comfortable with Copilot in an IDE and with the basics of Copilot CLI (running `copilot`, having a chat, accepting an edit). You want to:

- Use Copilot CLI as your primary agent surface, not as a fallback when you're away from your editor.
- Codify your team's conventions so Copilot follows them automatically.
- Build reusable skills and custom agents instead of re-prompting from scratch every session.
- Extend Copilot CLI with MCP servers and integrate it into a real end-to-end workflow (audit → backlog → fix → PR → review).

## The scenario

You've just inherited **AssetTrack** at **Contoso Industries** — an internal asset-tracking application built on Spring Boot 2.7, Java 11, jQuery, Bootstrap 3, SQLite, and a couple of crusty Python scripts. It's a realistic brownfield app: missing tests, an SQL-injection-flavored repository method, unenforced business rules, a buggy dashboard, and Python scripts written in a deliberately old-fashioned style.

You'll work the legacy app from [`geektrainer/legacy-app`][legacy-app] throughout the course, using Copilot CLI to understand it, modernize it, and add to it.

## What you'll learn

Across the nine sections of this course you will:

- Run Copilot CLI productively against a brownfield repo, with a clear understanding of permissions, allowed directories, and approval flows.
- Author repo-level and scoped instructions so Copilot picks up your team's conventions automatically.
- Use plan-first prompting, diff review, and session controls to keep multi-turn work under control.
- Build agent skills that encode reusable, well-scoped tasks (e.g., a Python modernizer, a security-audit reporter).
- Compose custom agents with skills and instructions for focused jobs like migration planning and test authoring.
- Work with MCP — the built-in GitHub MCP tools, custom MCP servers, and the trust/distribution model around them.
- Tie it all together in an end-to-end workflow: audit the codebase, file issues, implement a fix, run tests, and open a PR — driven from the CLI.

## Course structure

Each section is a single markdown file under [`content/`](./content/). Sections build on each other but each section's exercises include a starting-state note so you can drop in if you need to.
